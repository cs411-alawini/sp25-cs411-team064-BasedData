## Project Summary

Our project is a web application that assists learners in designing their own customized lesson plans. It creates a plan based on data from previous courses, transfer credits, AP credits, and competency test scores. The app allows users to input their academic objectives and desired courses, and it generates a personalized plan that illustrates the most efficient route to graduation. It takes into account variables such as course prerequisites, graduation requirements, and the potential for early graduation. Students can easily identify their academic route thanks to the user-friendly design, which also helps them track their progress toward their degree and make informed class selections.
