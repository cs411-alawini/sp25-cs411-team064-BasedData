## Project Summary

MedMatch is an all-in-one tool for users to help diagnose their symptoms, find the disease that best matches what they are experiencing, and recommend either an over-the-counter treatment or a doctorâ€™s visit. Using a dataset of 400 different diseases and another of thousands of FDA approved medications, users can find medication that is tailored to their needs. If the suggested medication is available over-the-counter, the application will find the closest pharmacies and present them on a map to the user. If the medication requires a prescription, MedMatch will suggest visiting their personal healthcare provider for a more comprehensive diagnosis. 

 Additionally, MedMatch will allow users to share their own experience with different medications. People have different reactions to the same medications, so it is important for these experiences to be shared to someone who may be wary of what medication to take. If a user permits it, they can share biomedical information in the review of the medication. This will allow people with similar body types or medical history to compare with people alike to them. By building a transparent community of people with shared medical experiences, MedMatch will contribute towards the end of medical anxiety and a healthier world.
